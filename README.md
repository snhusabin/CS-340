I also take care to write clean, modular code with good function names, comments, and an even formatting layout. For example, in Project One, I developed a re-usable CRUD Python module, which consolidated the database operations as separate, commented functions. The simplicity of connecting the module with the dashboard in Project Two was made easy without duplicating the database logic. Writing this way allows for re-usability of codes and debugging becomes easy. In the future, I can use this CRUD module in other MongoDB applications by simply changing the database or collection parameters.

I begin by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I started off by understanding the client's requirements, like filtering rescue dogs by training type and viewing their locations. I mapped each requirement to a feature (e.g., map markers or dropdown filters) and developed iteratively, testing each part before moving on. This mapping was unique compared to earlier assignments because I needed to consider more the client's perspective, remembering usability and scalability. In future projects, I would continue to use requirement analysis, modular design, and iterative development to deliver solutions tailored to client requirements.

Computer scientists convert real-world problems into computer systems that handle information by creating, building, and optimizing them. My work on this dashboard makes Grazioso Salvare more efficient by providing an easy way of filtering, visualizing, and handling rescue dog data. Such a tool saves time, reduces errors, and helps in making better decisions, which subsequently allows organizations like Grazioso Salvare to serve their purpose more effectively.
